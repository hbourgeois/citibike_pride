# Citi Bike Analysis Report

Observation 1: The top station for usage was University Place & E 14th St. Hypothesis: This station's high usage is likely due to its location midway between the start and end points of the NYC Pride parade, placing it in the heart of the festivities.

Observation 2: Yankee Ferry Terminal was an outlier in terms of usage. Its popularity during both years can be attributed to the Yankees playing at home all three days during Pride; in 2023, they played against the Astros, and in 2024, they played against Toronto.

Observation 3: Usage spikes were consistent with typical workday hours.

Observation 4: Traditional bikes had specific hot spots, while e-bikes were more widely used across the city.
